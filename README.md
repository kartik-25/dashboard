# Falcon

[Falcon](http://falcon.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com:8080/) is a public transport management ecosystem which paves the way towards unprecedented reduction in accidents, delays and costs.

## Why is Falcon needed?
* In an age where positioning systems are dirt cheap, we still hear of train collisions, something that can easily be avoided by simply tracking positions. 
* Scheduling is still done manually. 
* Traffic lights still use the same timeout for all directions, irrespective of the traffic load. 
* Public transport is not responsive to shift in demands between locations in the short term. 

And this is just scratching the surface. There are much more issues that can be solved with Falcon.

## What can be done?
Falcon's only requirement is tracking of all vehicles.
  
Once the trains relay their information to the central server, falcon can, 
* inform of an impending collision. 
* take in as input the various stations, trains and their schedules, and generate a heatmap based on the data to figure out which areas are more prone to accidents.  
* take in stations, and train speeds and their routes, and figure out an optimal schedule ensuring minimum wastage of time.  
  
Just the above use cases ensure huge reurns in terms of lives, efficiency, responsiveness and costs by eliminating the need for excessive manual work and human error.
    
This model can be extended to all sorts of media of transport in a similar manner. 
* The timing of traffic lights can be modified on the basis of traffic variation across routes. 
* Emergency vehicles such as Ambulances and Police Cars can be given priority, and the roads in their path given maximum flow.
* Vehicles can be managed to respond intelligently to changes in traffic.
